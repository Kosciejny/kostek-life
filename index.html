    <h2>The Cause of This Website</h2>
	<p>There are a few reasons for this website to exist. First of all, I love creating things — especially digitally. Why English then, even though it’s not my native language? The answer is very simple: learning, reading, writing, and thinking in English helps me improve. This page is not indexed, and I don't plan on changing that anytime soon. Only people who are somewhat close to me — most likely friends or people I "work" with (people I talk to about physics from all over the world) — have access to it. I don't expect anyone to actually read any of this nonsense, but the idea that somebody might stumble across it someday is pretty cool.</p>
